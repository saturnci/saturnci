# Implement $ARGUMENTS

## Step 1: Understand the request

Repeat the request back to the user in your own words and ask if you have the right understanding.

## Step 2: Implement the change using TDD

1. Decide on the specifications.
2. Encode the specifications in a test.
3. Run the test and observe the failure.
4. Write just enough code to make the failure go away (NOT enough code to necessarily make the test pass).
5. Repeat from step 3 until the test passes.

Always check relevant CLAUDE.md files for patterns and examples.
