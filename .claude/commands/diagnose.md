# Diagnose $ARGUMENTS

Diagnose the described problem.
Before you begin the diagnosis, make sure you have an accurate and appropriately specific understanding of the presenting symptoms.
If you're not 100% sure you understand, ask questions.

Remember: a diagnosis is an explanation.

Come up with some hypotheses as to what the explanation could be.
Subject your hypotheses to skeptical scrutiny and criticism.
Try as hard as you can to disprove each hypothesis before considering it to be plausible.
For each hypothesis, you may need more information and you may not.
If you need more information, there may be a test you can perform to get that information. If so, do it.
Don't jump to conclusions. Remember that a good explanation is specific, hard to vary, and has survived rigorous attempts to disprove it.
