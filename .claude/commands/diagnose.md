# Diagnose $ARGUMENTS

Diagnose the described problem.
Before you begin the diagnosis, make sure you have an accurate and appropriately specific understanding of the presenting symptoms.
If you're not 100% sure you understand, ask questions.

Create a text file and keep running notes on your diagnosis process.
Write down the symptoms, your hypotheses and your findings.

Remember: a diagnosis is an explanation.

Come up with some hypotheses as to what the explanation could be.
Subject your hypotheses to skeptical scrutiny and criticism.
Try as hard as you can to disprove each hypothesis before considering it to be plausible.
For each hypothesis, you may need more information and you may not.
If you need more information, there may be a test you can perform to get that information. If so, do it.
Don't jump to conclusions. Remember that a good explanation is specific, hard to vary, and has survived rigorous attempts to disprove it.

Once you think you've arrived at the correct diagnosis, the correct next step is to write a test which reproduces the bug and then run the test.
If the test does not fail in the way you expected, then your diagnosis is suspect and you may still have work to do.
